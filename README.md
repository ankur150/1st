I applied K-Means clustering on Facebook Live Sellers data to group posts based on engagement metrics. Preprocessing techniques included Label Encoding and Standardization (using StandardScaler for numerical features). Using the Elbow Method, we determined the optimal number of clusters, trained the model, and visualized clusters and centroids.
The goal of this project was to analyze the impact of different advertising mediums (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on Sales and build a linear regression model to predict sales based on ad expenditures. I used Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
